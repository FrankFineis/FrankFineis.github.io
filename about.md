Thanks for checking out this blog! I'm Frank, an aspiring data scientist, part-time employee at Uptake and full-time researcher at Northwestern University. While the term _data science_ can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, I'll focus on what's been useful to me and what one can expect to find covered in a typical introduction to machine learning type of book. I will most likely stick with R and Python (perhaps more heavily towards R), but this is not to say that _data science_ is limited to these two programming languages - shout outs to Javascript, Matlab, and Julia!
