Alright, so you're an aspiring data scientist, say a graduate student in a STEM field trying to get into private industry, and congratulations, you've made it to the case study round! What do I mean by *case study*? Ah, I mean a timed test with a *training set* and a *test set*. You've been instructed to build a model that will give predicted values for the observations contained in the test set, and then your (hopefully) future employer will compare your values with the test set's true values. Few things get more meritocratic than that!

<br />

## General steps involved:
1. Load your data. Poke around.
2. Decide on an appropriate mathematical/machine learning model you'd like to use.
3. Create a data processing pipeline for both your training and test data sets.
⋅⋅a. Pick features you'd like to try in your model. A **feature** is generally a column within your dataset fed into your machine learning model.
⋅⋅b. If applicable, standardize or normalize various features.
4. Tune the model's hyperparameters through validation.
5. Fit model with decided upon hyperparameters with all of your training data.
6. Get predictions on the processed test data.
